### How to use **Black Dragon** 

Before anything make sure you clone the repo and install the executable before anything. To clone the repo perform the action:


```
git clone https://github.com/KKanda900/Black-Dragon

```

After you clone the repo then install the executable by:

```
go build
```

After you build the program in the directory then you should see an executable for your platform. Click on the exe and then you should see the terminal startup. After the terminal is started up and you see the current directory you can run the exe depending on your system. After you have it running then you can do anything like a regular terminal. If you want a list of commands that are currently on the terminal then you do `-h` or `help`.

## About 

This idea of a terminal came from when taking my Internet Technology class and Computer Security class. There are many tools out to the public that involve Computer Networking and Computer Security and for anyone in the field knows there are alot of important tools. So this terminal combines alot of tools into a easy form factor that anyone can use.

## How to Install 

When you clone the repo, enter into the directory. When you are on the directory then you can simply do 

```
go build
```

Then this will install an executable on to your platform which you can press to start.
